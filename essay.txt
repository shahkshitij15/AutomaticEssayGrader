Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 more and more people start to use computers, goes more and more into the dark aged. While computer @MONTH1 be helpful in some cases, they are also making people excercize less, most @CAPS1 many people are nature, and more people are becoming awkward. So are computer advancement recently worth society becoming less interactive? The answer is no. With more thing to do on the computer people arent getting enough exercize to keep up a healthy regimens. Kids would rather waste time on the computer than go out play. @NUM1 years ago, when most that many people had computers, you could see people outside playing and having fun with each other, But now, when you look outside, no one is on the local playground having fun and exercising, they are on the internet. "@PERCENT1 of kids, who spend most of their time on the computer, are over-weight and unhealthy, compared to the @PERCENT2 of kids who are outside playing and a healthy weight." says @PERSON1, @CAPS2. So really the problem to over-weight, its lack of exercize from the computers. Not only are people getting less exercize, they are also not experiencing the healty of nature. With less people going going outside, of exercize, waste nature healty because no-one gets to use it, and harm social skills and family relationships. So please, get off the computer and enjoy life.
